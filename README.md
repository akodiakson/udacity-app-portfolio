#udacity-app-portfolio

This was the first and second project of the Android Udacity Nanodegree.

The app lets you search for artists, browse albums, and play 30 second samples of songs. 

This project used the Spotify Web API for streaming. I also used the Palette, Picasso, Otto and Retrofit APIs.
